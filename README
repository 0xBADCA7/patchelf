PatchELF is simple utility for modifing existing ELF executables and
libraries.  In particular, it can do the following:

* Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executables:

  $ patchelf --set-interpreter /lib/my-ld-linux.so.2 my-program

* Change the RPATH of executables and libraries:

  $ patchelf --set-rpath /opt/my-libs/lib:/other-libs my-program

* Shrink the RPATH of executables and libraries:

  $ patchelf --shrink-rpath /opt/my-libs/lib:/other-libs my-program

  This removes from the RPATH all directories that do not contain a
  library referenced by DT_NEEDED fields of the executable or library.
  For instance, if an executable references one library libfoo.so, has
  an RPATH "/lib:/usr/lib:/foo/lib", and libfoo.so can only be found
  in /foo/lib, then the new RPATH will be "/foo/lib".

BUGS

Currently setting the RPATH on libraries ("--set-rpath") will usually
fail if the new RPATH is longer then the old RPATH.
